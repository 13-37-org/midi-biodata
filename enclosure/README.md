## Enclosure design files

All design files are made with FreeCAD (fcstd files). 
The provided STL files are not neccesarily up to date, but it's all compatible.

### Main body

This version is 5mm higher than the earlier revision, so it fits the classic MIDI Biodata Sonification devices,
even those with trough-hole LEDs or a protruding oscillator.

But I also recommend it for variants with flat LEDs (like newer devices from DataGarden or the the MIDI Biodata Sonification Device v2.1 by 13-37.org)
as it has better light diffusion with the increased distance.

### Main body

This version fits only the MIDI biodata Sonification Device v2.1 by 13-37.org, and is 5mm smaller(in height) than the version above.

Just a plate of 51,5mm x 48,75mm x 1mm. It snaps into the main body.
